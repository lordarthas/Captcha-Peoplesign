#usageNotes
##-call this when processing the user's response to peoplesign ONLY if you 
## setup peoplesign with get_html

#description
##-looks for peoplesignSessionID and peoplesignResponseString in the request 
## variables
## array unless you pass them as arguments.
##-calls processPeoplesignResponse
##-sends a cookie header.  The cookie containing the peoplesign session 
## is refreshed if it's still needed, otherwise it's set to empty string and
## is expired.

#parameters
##1)peoplesignSessionID
###-this should have been included (named PEOPLESIGN_CHALLENGE_SESSION_ID_NAME)
### as form data (usually found in http post data) from the form
### that included the peoplesign HTML.  It should have been passed
### as a hidden input.
### If you pass null or empty string, the routine will attempt to find it. 

##2)peoplesignResponseString
###-this should should have been passed as a hidden
### input in the same form mentioned above.  The 
###-if you are using getPeoplesignHTMLIFrame (rare)
### request variable named PEOPLESIGN_CHALLENGE_RESPONSE_NAME 
### won't be set, but the user's 
### browser will have already sent it to the peoplesign server.

##3)client Location
###-MUST match the argument passed to get_html.

##4)peoplesignKey
###-obtain your key from peoplesign.com

#usageNotes
##-use this (instead of isPeoplesignResponseCorrect) if your application
## is using CGI::Session or if it has already sent http headers before 
## it checks the peoplesign response
##-use the first element of the return value (an array) to determine if the 
## user's response is correct.
##-use the second element of the return value to determine if you need to 
## persist the peoplesign session id using a session variable or cookie.

##-calls getPeoplesignSessionStatus, refreshes the cookie expiration time

##2)peoplesignResponseString

=head1 NAME

Captcha::Peoplesign - Easily integrate Peoplesign CAPTCHA in your
Perl application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Captcha::Peoplesign;

    my $ps = Captcha::Peoplesign->new;

    # Output form
    print $c->get_html( 'you_key', 'your_location' );

    # Verify submission
    my $result = $c->check_answer(
        'your_key', 'your_submission',
        $challenge, $response
    );

    if ( $result->{is_valid} ) {
        print "Yes!";
    }
    else {
        # Error
        $error = $result->{error};
    }

For some examples, please see the /examples subdirectory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Peoplesign is a clever CAPTCHA system which is quite a departure
from the standard ones where you need to guess a difficult word.

To use Peoplesign you need to register your site here:

L<https://peoplesign.com>

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item C<< new >>

Create a new C<< Captcha::reCAPTCHA >>.

=item C<< get_html( $pubkey, $error, $use_ssl, $options ) >>

Generates HTML to display the captcha.

    print $captcha->get_html( $PUB, $err );

=over

=item C<< $pubkey >>

Your reCAPTCHA public key, from the API Signup Page

=item C<< $error >>

Optional. If set this should be either a string containing a reCAPTCHA
status code or a result hash as returned by C<< check_answer >>.

=item C<< $use_ssl >>

Optional. Should the SSL-based API be used? If you are displaying a page
to the user over SSL, be sure to set this to true so an error dialog
doesn't come up in the user's browser.

=item C<< $options >>

Optional. A reference to a hash of options for the captcha. See 
C<< get_options_setter >> for more details.

=back

Returns a string containing the HTML that should be used to display
the captcha.

=item C<< get_options_setter( $options ) >>

You can optionally customize the look of the reCAPTCHA widget with some
JavaScript settings. C<get_options_setter> returns a block of Javascript
wrapped in <script> .. </script> tags that will set the options to be used
by the widget.

C<$options> is a reference to a hash that may contain the following keys:

=over

=item C<theme>

Defines which theme to use for reCAPTCHA. Possible values are 'red',
'white' or 'blackglass'. The default is 'red'.

=item C<tabindex>

Sets a tabindex for the reCAPTCHA text box. If other elements in the
form use a tabindex, this should be set so that navigation is easier for
the user. Default: 0.

=back

=item C<< check_answer >>

After the user has filled out the HTML form, including their answer for
the CAPTCHA, use C<< check_answer >> to check their answer when they
submit the form. The user's answer will be in two form fields,
recaptcha_challenge_field and recaptcha_response_field. The reCAPTCHA
library will make an HTTP request to the reCAPTCHA server and verify the
user's answer.

=over

=item C<< $privkey >>

Your reCAPTCHA private key, from the API Signup Page.

=item C<< $remoteip >>

The user's IP address, in the format 192.168.0.1.

=item C<< $challenge >>

The value of the form field recaptcha_challenge_field

=item C<< $response >>

The value of the form field recaptcha_response_field.

=back

Returns a reference to a hash containing two fields: C<is_valid>
and C<error>.

    my $result = $c->check_answer(
        'your private key here', $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'},
        $challenge, $response
    );

    if ( $result->{is_valid} ) {
        print "Yes!";
    }
    else {
        # Error
        $error = $result->{error};
    }

See the /examples subdirectory for examples of how to call C<check_answer>.
